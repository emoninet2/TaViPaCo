The TaViPaCo (Tangible Virtual Patch Cords) is a system to tangibly 
manipulate the virtual patching cords in graphical programming 
environments, such as Max and Pure Data. The system includes
a physical interface, a communication protocol, and a software library, 
providing physical extension of the graphical programming paradigm. 
The repository includes the related software for MAX and Pure Data, the 
interface schematics and Arduino code.
